Limit study to 3 fluids problem (gas-liquid-gas and liquid-gas-liquid) Define what makes a soap bubble: presence of surfactant (brief explanation of amphiphilic properties). This is opposed to \"bare\" bubbles, which will be used in this paper when studying transient effects. Explain geometries explored? curved or planar film, and multiple bubbles (foams and porous liquids)? Going to look at both surface bubbles and \"free?\" bubbles. Surface bubbles can be just considered as a curved film (the bubble) cap, connected to its bulk liquid via a meniscus (the bubble periphery, known as a Plateau border) What make bubble unique, what makes relevant, guide the reader to relevance, set the scene Reference a lot of papers in the introductions Outline areas that will be explored - we won't be looking at the creation of the bubble, as that doesn't really affect its lifetime as said in Lhuissier. Stable curved films \u00b6 This section seems kind of weak and disjointed compared to the bubble death one. Might need to find a better structure Role of surfactant \u00b6 Detailed explanation of underlying physics behind the surface tension reducing capabilities of surfactants. Outline the different types of surfactants and how surfactant concentration affects bubble stability. Organisation into two surfactant monolayers which stabilise the film. Concept of surface or film pressure Two types of surfactant - soluble and insoluble, how that leads to different effects?? -> \"Mobile\" and \"Static\" monolayers (Manev E, Scheludko A, Exerowa D 1974) (Sane A, Mandre S, Kim I. 2018) (Modini RL et al 2013) (ChampougnyNotBare2016) (Bhamla MS et al 2017): stability ++ with surfactant (Bico2015) has a good diagram for those effects \"Rigid\" and \"Mobile\" film surfaces \u00b6 Based on surfactant solubility and viscosity (Bruinsma1995) Drainage mechansisms are studied in detail (Bhamla2017) Mysels classified in 3 categories (Langevin1994): - Rigid films: monolayers are extremely compact and rigid - Simple mobile films: Rapid turbulent motion observed (driven by marangoni effect, and said to be triggered by marginial regeneration flows Lhuissier2011), and \"thickness of the center is uniform\" eg for low conc soluble surfactants. - Irregular mobile films: High conc surfactant, larger thickness surfactants observed, \"Stratification\" Surface viscosity is dependant on how fast surfactant molecules can diffuse from the bulk to film surfaces when it is streched (Bico2015) The Marangoni Effect \u00b6 Very prevalent effect, which is the driving mechanism behind the transient structures observed on bubble surface (different thicknesses lead to different light interference resulting in colours). Is what gives a certain elasticity to the film. Marangoni effect will carry surfactnat molecules from zones of high concentration to low concentration. So like if we stretch the film, surfactant concentration decreases in certain areas, increasing surface tension, and driving more low-surface tension zones towards it. Compensate for the weight of the film (Bico2015) Mention that this mechanism also plays a role in film thinning and drainage. (Bhamla MS et al 2017) (Nierstrasz1999) (Possible other sections) \u00b6 Bubble size and shape, the Young-Laplace Equation , and link with contained volume pressure. (Lhuissier2011 has a pretty good description) Bubble coalescence, when two merge, forms a brand new one which has same characteristis as a Young film Behaviour in EM fields: Moses Effect Applications \u00b6 Applications of these stable films: 2D flow approximation (Kellay H. 2017) Study vortices Test models for friction (with the flowing 2D film case) (thin film interference, not really an application though...) Discussion \u00b6 What the EffectsWe ahve seeen so far that when a curved is stable, there are several physicl phenoment at play Elaboration CRITICAL VIEW 2 Paragraphs even Talk about the thickness models -> Lhuissier2011's one was backed up by Modini2013. Surfactant concentration and surface tension Surfactant type? Soluble and insoluble... see in film drainage mechanisms tho Bubble Death (Interactions with the environment) \u00b6 Film thinning mechanisms and rupture initialisation \u00b6 Film undergo thinning mechanisms which reduce its thickness either down to the thinnest possible value (black films), or directly to rupture. Location point of rupture is different between a bubble sitting on bulk liquid, or held at a small point. Maybe talk about how Lhuissier has an amazing paper that goes through every step that leads to rupture... Gravity and capillary drainage \u00b6 Effects which occur when the film is young (still relatively thick), and occur regardless of the presence of surfactants. What is gravity driven draining? What is capillary draiange? As pointed out by Lhuissier2011, depends on bubble size. (smaller bubbles will be more spherical and under the surface, while bigger are less, and more above.) Notes that for bubbles R<5a, the capillary pressure is dominant or matches the hydrostatic pressure (due to gravity), and intuitively that makes sense. For bubbles with R<5a (Lhuissier2011), main effect is capillary pressure: Same mechanism occurs in foams, where liquid drains into the Plateau borders instead of a bulk liquid (Breward2002). Plateau borders are ???. Regardless of whether hydrostatic or capillary are the driving mechanisms, flow is really easy to compute, as they are simple pressure driven flows. A pressure gradient will drive liquid out of the cap, through the meniscus and into the bulk liquid (or directly into a Plateau border in the case of foams). Hagen-Poiseuille or very simple plug flow equations are used to determine the flowrate out of the cap. (Nierstrasz1999 and Bruinsma1995 calls it Poiseuille flow when monolayers are static/rigid), (Debregeas1998, Lhuissier2011, Breward2002 call it plug flow, when there are no surfactants involved). (short bit on what is Plug flow, and maybe the different equations that Lhuissier2011, Debregeas1998 and Breward2002 used) -> ChampougnyNotBare2016 \"the flow profile is increasingly plug-like as the surfactant concentration is decreased from several times the critical micellar concentration (cmc) to just below the cmc\". Leads to extremely rapid drainage for water, when no surfactants are present (Breward2002, Debregeas1998, Lhuissier2011). Lhuissier2011 points out that the only effect that could slow down the drainage would be viscous stretching (viscous forces would oppose the stretching), but that has a characteristic time of 10e-4 s. Repeat the role of surfactant mentionned in section XXX, and how it makes sense now. Since viscosity is a factor in eqs, studied very viscous, to increase lifetime: Is the sole drainage mechanism in bare bubbles - Plug Flow (Debregeas1998) Experiments show a simple exponential thinning of the film, proportional to cap radius. Explain by getting the plug flow velocity field, and doing conservation equation. In their case, gravity was the driving force. Show the Lhuissier Figure 8, where drainage occurs more rapidly than the expected Poiseuille flow. (Lhuissier2011). Why? MARGINAL REGENERATION Marginal Regeneration \u00b6 Use the Lhuissier Image. Very interesting film thinning effect caused by the presence of free moving surface particles (like surfactants!). When a bubble is sitting on a bulk liquid, this film draining mechanism is orders of magnitude more significant than the usual pressure-driven Poiseuille draining. Easier to observe on flat films due to light, but also seen in bubbles Although they are more easily studied in flat films due to the need for light to pass through, This great picture by Lhuissier and Villermaux clearly shows the convective structures at the base of the bubble, indicative of marginal regeneration. (Bhamla2017) (Mysels, Karol Joseph (1959). Soap films : studies of their thinning. Pergamon Press, London) <- FIRST PAPER (Lhuissier2011) Physical explanations from different papers, compare: - Nierstrasz1999 -> localized zones of high surface tension - Bhamla2017 -> Details into the plumes dynamics (great data about soluble/insoluble surfactants) - Lhuissier2011 -> It is the destabilisation of the pinching region which leads to marginal regeneration. Destabilisation of type Benard-Marangoni, driven by the surface tension difference across the region. - ChampougnyEvap2018 -> \"Patches\" formed near the meniscus - Bruinsma1995 -> MAKE A TABLE WITH DRAINAGE MECHANISMS FOR SOLUBLE AND INSOLUBLE SURFACTANTS AT BELOW AND ABOVE CMC Common and Newton Black films \u00b6 The thinnest possible stable bubble thickness; where it is now stable because the two boundaries are so close, the surfactant molecules can interact directly. Exist two possible types - Common and Newton black films. Evaporation is apparently significant at this thickness (ChampougnyEvap2018) Old paper talks the stabilisation to a black film (looking at corrugations) (Vrij1968) Model for bubble thinning, and patterns exhibited by those spots (Shen2020) Notice for detergent type surfactants at a threshold concentration will allow formation (Manev1974) For solutions above CMC, observe formation before rupture (Bhamla2017) Intermolecular interactions balance out capillary suction (Breward2002) Rupture initialisation \u00b6 Why? \u00b6 What causes the bubble to become unstable and rupture? - (VrijDiscussion1966) Main working theory at the time is thermal fluctuations cause surface \"corrugations\", which grow over time, and when a critical wavelength is reached, cause spontaneous rupture. Proposes model for this wavelength, dependant on surface tension and the \"Free energy of interaction\" (essentially the intermolecular forces acting in the surfactant bilayer). - (Langevin1994) criticised this: apparently critical thickness isn't dependant on bubble radius or surface tension?. - (Vrij1968) Very early paper in 1968 talks about 'corrugations' on the surface, which cause spontaneous thinning at a critical wavelength due to an imbalance in surface Gibbs energy (surface tension) and van de Walls forces. Lhuissier2011 gives an energy of activation (ChampougnyEvap2018) mentions the introduction of instability due to ambient evaporation (when films are at critical thicknesses) (Debregeas1998) High viscosity \"bare\" bubbles, said to burst when (at h ~ 70nm) \"long-range Van der Waals interactions enhance film thinning\" (Manev1974) Also talk about a critical thickness In some cases, it might be useful to trigger a bubble rupture event manually, look at how different experiments did it: \u00b6 Discuss the different methods used to purposefully rupture a bubble, (spark, needle, EM field, ultrasound ...) Where? \u00b6 When the main drainage mechanism is not Marginal regeneration (either capillary or hydrostatic), there is radial symmetry, and hole nucleates at top of bubble (Debregeas1998, ChampougnyNotBare2016). And how the position of the hole depends on surfactant concentration (ChampougnyNotBare2016). Nucleation seems to occur around a convection cell (rising plume mentionned in Marginal regeneration) (Lhuissier2011) -> kinda contradicts what ChampougnyNotBare2016 found? Hole Development \u00b6 Maybe talk about how its not really directly relevant to stability, as the bubble has already burst, but very interesting and has significant impact. One of the biggest use cases for bubbles is aerosol production, in sea water bla bla (Lhuissier2011). Undestanding the dynamics of rupture also give insight into some of the characterisitcs that make it stable, and can be used to find the critical film thickness (Lhuissier2011). Rim Velocity \u00b6 Velocity of the initially circular opening hole. Primitively modelled by the Taylor-Culick velocity (Culick1960), but widely accepted to be an overestimation. In fact is neglects viscosity (Brenner1999), make a paragraph about effect of viscosity Go over different propositions for this deviation: Some papers point to the small fluid particles that are ejected from the rim (Muller2009) Some mention a build-up of surfactant particles on the travelling edge, causing it to take an elongated shape, and develop a surface tension gradient (Bico2015) A lot point to the formation of an 'aureole', where away from the opening rim, folds and 'cracks' are observed (which is where some of the energy could be going). \"Opening and retraction of particulate soap films\" <- Read to find if there's anything useful (Timounay2015) (Savva2009) Appearance of instabilities \u00b6 The bubble's hole doesn't stay circular the whole time, instabilities arrise which cause certain structures to be observed: Formation of ligaments Folds or cracks ahead of the rim Briefly introduce the Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities The aftermath \u00b6 After the bubble has burst, it will either disintegrate into a very thin aerosol mist, or form greater-sized droplets. This has significant impacts, especially in the analysis of this effect in sea water. (Modini2013) Film and jet drops * Talk about their baller experimental setup * Apparently other models differ by orders of magnitude (Spiel1998) Applications \u00b6 Mention the significant role bursting (unstable) bubbles have in: Aerosol production Liquid atomization Drug delivery READ (de Gennes, P. G., Brochart-Wyart, F. & Quer\u00b4 e, D. \u00b4 2003 Capillarity and Wetting Phenomena: Drops, Bubbles, Pearls, Waves. Springer.) (Daughter bubble cascades produced by folding of ruptured thin films, Bird) Stabilisatio of bubbles and foams, Brent S Murray (applications in the food industry, + it looks like there's a list in the intro) Discussion \u00b6 Discuss the unstable effects - personal opinion, what people did well etc Surfactants are vital or else drains mega fast - Viscosity for no surfactants Need further info about influence of evaporation at rupture Although marginal regeneration was specifically observed in surface bubbles and foams, and we couldn't find a paper which studied its effect in \"free\", spherical bubbles. We could expect it to occur around the build-up of fluid at the base of concave bubbles (Shen2020) Drainage mechanisms and rupture are a priori linked, as thinner films are more likely to rupture. But this onset of bursting, although quantitatively descried is not yet fully understood. Overall, many effects still not fully understood, especially those pertaining to the drainage dynamics and hole nucleation. Improving stability \u00b6 Looking back at all the effects described above, recap about how we could improve the stability of a bubble: Bubble make up Surfactant type: Concentration: prefer higher concentration, to stiffen the surface, reduce effect of marginal regeneration () Solubility: prefer insoluble surfactants to soluble as rigid surfaces drain slower (Petit2015, Bhamla2017, ChampougnyNotBare2016) Diffusivity: if soluble surfactant, want really high diffusivity, so it can quickly react to external fluctuation (like if films stretches, want particles to move quick from bulk) Viscosity (more viscous drain slower, and therefore live longer) (Debregeas1998, Savva2009, Brenner1999) Larger bubbles drain slower (Debregeas1998), but become more sensitive to external fluctuations. Environment (low-high humidity, velocities, EM field) Although more research is required to confirm this, but placing the bubble in a humid environemnt, which would reduce the effect of evaportation could be useful (ChampougnyEvap2018) (READ BHAMLA) Develop a few statements over 2-3 important points for each section Conclusions \u00b6 Not sure we need this part (the \"Improving stability\" section is already kind of a summary) Extract key points from above Dry statement - recap In this LRP we have been addressing thin films - bubbles or curved films several stable effects and then Bursting, we touched on....

What is gravity driven draining? What is capillary draiange? As pointed out by Lhuissier2011, depends on bubble size. (smaller bubbles will be more spherical and under the surface, while bigger are less, and more above.) Notes that for bubbles R<5a, the capillary pressure is dominant or matches the hydrostatic pressure (due to gravity), and intuitively that makes sense. For bubbles with R<5a (Lhuissier2011), main effect is capillary pressure: Same mechanism occurs in foams, where liquid drains into the Plateau borders instead of a bulk liquid (Breward2002). Plateau borders are ???. Regardless of whether hydrostatic or capillary are the driving mechanisms, flow is really easy to compute, as they are simple pressure driven flows. A pressure gradient will drive liquid out of the cap, through the meniscus and into the bulk liquid (or directly into a Plateau border in the case of foams). Hagen-Poiseuille or very simple plug flow equations are used to determine the flowrate out of the cap. (Nierstrasz1999 and Bruinsma1995 calls it Poiseuille flow when monolayers are static/rigid), (Debregeas1998, Lhuissier2011, Breward2002 call it plug flow, when there are no surfactants involved). (short bit on what is Plug flow, and maybe the different equations that Lhuissier2011, Debregeas1998 and Breward2002 used) -> ChampougnyNotBare2016 \"the flow profile is increasingly plug-like as the surfactant concentration is decreased from several times the critical micellar concentration (cmc) to just below the cmc\". Leads to extremely rapid drainage for water, when no surfactants are present (Breward2002, Debregeas1998, Lhuissier2011). Lhuissier2011 points out that the only effect that could slow down the drainage would be viscous stretching (viscous forces would oppose the stretching), but that has a characteristic time of 10e-4 s. Repeat the role of surfactant mentionned in section XXX, and how it makes sense now. Since viscosity is a factor in eqs, studied very viscous, to increase lifetime: Is the sole drainage mechanism in bare bubbles - Plug Flow (Debregeas1998) Experiments show a simple exponential thinning of the film, proportional to cap radius. Explain by getting the plug flow velocity field, and doing conservation equation. In their case, gravity was the driving force.

Argue that evaporation, adding an external flux from film to atmosphere, could accelerate the thinning mechanisms, and even be cause/accelerate the instabilities observed: for heterogeneous interfaces, local evaporation will vary as stabilizing agents can influence those rates, causing temperature and surface concentration gradients, which would lead to further instabilities. Experimental results show that the thinning dynamics are almost not affected by evaporation. However, discover that evaporation becomes important at the 'black film' level, close to rupture. Propose that rupture occurs when mass loss due to evaporation is of the order of mass loss due to film drainage at the top of the film.

Surface tension acts against the thickness variations, whereas \"Van der Waals\" forces will act to move particles from thinner areas towards thicker, accentuating thickness variations. This paper poses that if the decrease in van der Waals energy more than compensates the increase in surface Gibbs energy (the corrugated film has a larger surface area, therefore more surface energy), then the deformation would spontaneously grow and lead to either a full rupture, or stabilisation to 'black film'. Note: This reminds me of the Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, the growth of an instability due to a density gradient.

Comes up with a critical wavelength for fluctuations which cause rupture. This wavelength is dependant on surface tension and the \"Free energy of interaction\" (essentially the intermolecular forces acting in the surfactant bilayer). Black film rupture occurs unpredictably due to lack of control over environment: thermal shock, vibration, dust. These are unlikely to cause hole nucleation in thicker films due to high activation energy, mechanism is therefore only relevant in those thin bilayers. Unstable, or transient films, rupture spontaneously. Main working theory at the time is thermal fluctuations cause surface \"corrugations\", which grow over time, and when a critical wavelength is reached, cause spontaneous rupture. Citation Vrij A.

Comes up with a critical wavelength for fluctuations which cause rupture. This wavelength is dependant on surface tension and the \"Free energy of interaction\" (essentially the intermolecular forces acting in the surfactant bilayer). Black film rupture occurs unpredictably due to lack of control over environment: thermal shock, vibration, dust. These are unlikely to cause hole nucleation in thicker films due to high activation energy, mechanism is therefore only relevant in those thin bilayers. Unstable, or transient films, rupture spontaneously. Main working theory at the time is thermal fluctuations cause surface \"corrugations\", which grow over time, and when a critical wavelength is reached, cause spontaneous rupture. Citation Vrij A.

Carry out thinning experiments to quantify the slowing effect of surfactants on gravity-driven drainage. Looking at the difference between soluble and insoluble surfactants. Explain marginal regeneration by saying that surface-tension gradient driven plumes have an increased surface area near the top, meaning surfactant concentration is locally decreased, and surface tension therefore is increased. This area of high surface tension will cause liquid to be pulled up from the bulk liquid at the bubble's. That liquid has a lower surfactant concentration (as surfactant molecules adsorb?? at the surface), this reduces surfactant conc of bubble which destabilises and leads to bursting. Find that for both soluble and insoluble surfactant, adding it does increase the stability of the thin film. Find that Marangoni flows act to stabilise the film significantly, above and below the CMC for soluble surfactant laden films. For the insoluble surfactant laden films, see that at low surface pressure, \"marginal regeneration\" is observed: Initially the bubble has circular fringe patterns, exemplifying a symmetric thickness profile for the bubble. However after t < 2, plumes of surfactant are seen rising from the base of the bubble, these are driven by surface-tension gradients (Marangoni). After CMC, this doesn't happen tho and the film. At high surface pressure with insoluble, stability is achieved through \"interfacial rheology\", resulting in immobile surfaces. It is worth noting that for the solutions above the cmc, we also observe formation of black films before rupture (soluble surfactant) Citation Bhamla MS, Chai C, \u00c0lvarez-Valenzuela MA, Tajuelo J, Fuller GG (2017) Interfacial mechanisms for stability of surfactant-laden films.

Main focus of the paper is to find out the quantitative aerosol produced when a water bubble bursts. \"Aerosol\" being the hundreds of small droplets which are produced when thin film disintegrates. (shows that effect of evaporation is negligible in lifetime and stability calculations) Flat films are useful to be studied in 2D when surface viscosity (driven by high surfactant conc.) is large enough to dissipate all motion in the plane. But can't be used in bubbles, where convective motions are integral to describing the drainage. Describes the hole nucleation event through the bubble cap as stochastic. With activation energy of sigma*h^2 (sigma is surface tension, h is surface tension). Say that the formation of ligaments result from the inertial destabilization of the rim. Were Rayleigh-Taylor destabilization is the selection mechanism. This paper disproves Spiel's findings (Spiel1998, \"On the births of film drops from bubbles bursting on seawater surfaces\", talks about \"beads\" forming along the surface, at which surface tension can't maintain centripetal accelerations and get ejected always at the same angle (31deg) independent of bubble size and surface tension). Describes the bubble shape as a function of capillary length (a = sqrt(omega/rho g)). Neglects the weight of the cap (as thickness h is very small), and considers surface tension constant along the cap. Shape depends on the contained volume and conditions at the base (meniscus). Small bubbles will tend to be spherical and stay mostly under the surface, with a small cap angle, whereas bigger bubbles will tend to be more half-spherical and stick out. Drainage of the cap is driven by capillary pressure inside the cap (2sigma/R) or hydrostatic pressure (rho g R) depending on the ratio R/a (when <=5, calpillary draiange dominates). References the Debregeas drainage time for 'bare' molten glass bubbles, to show that pure water bubbles would drain almost immediately, as the only force that might slow down drainage is only viscosity. However show that for non-distilled water, the bubbles can exist for longer than 1s ( Significance of water purity; a very small amount of surfactant is required to improve lifetime significantly. ). Looking at low surfactant concentration tap water bubbles with \"mobile\" monolayers, which they argue can safely be extended to seawater bubbles at the surface of oceans.
