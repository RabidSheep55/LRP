  abstract = "Thin film technology is a mature field encompassing a wide range of applications such as electronics, optical communications, and biosystems. The list of potential applications is practically endless with an impact in nearly every industrial sector. Many thin film applications are linked to developments in the semiconductor industry such as thin film transistors, large-area displays, microelectromechanical/nanoelectromechanical systems, planar waveguides, and magnetic data storage. This introductory chapter provides a new insight into nanostructured thin films. It gives an overview on the application on thin films, a general classification of nanostructured thin films, a brief introduction of the methods of synthesis of these nanostructures. Finally, the chapter discusses the challenges faced during the scale-up of the processes and the most important aspects to be considered when planning the industrialization of a developed process."

 abstract = {Thin liquid films are central to everyday life. They are ubiquitous in modern technology (pharmaceuticals, coatings), consumer products (foams, emulsions) and also serve vital biological functions (tear film of the eye, pulmonary surfactants in the lung). A common feature in all these examples is the presence of surface-active molecules at the air-liquid interface. Though they form only molecular-thin layers, these surfactants produce complex surface stresses on the free surface, which have important consequences for the dynamics and stability of the underlying thin liquid film. Here we conduct simple thinning experiments to explore the fundamental mechanisms that allow the surfactant molecules to slow the gravity-driven drainage of the underlying film. We present a simple model that works for both soluble and insoluble surfactant systems in the limit of negligible adsorption-desorption dynamics. We show that surfactants with finite surface rheology influence bulk flow through viscoelastic interfacial stresses, while surfactants with inviscid surfaces achieve stability through opposing surface-tension induced Marangoni flows.},

 abstract  ="In this paper{,} we investigate how the drainage and rupture of surfactant-stabilised bubbles floating at the surface of a liquid pool depend on the concentration of surface-active molecules in water. Drainage measurements at the apex of bubbles indicate that the flow profile is increasingly plug-like as the surfactant concentration is decreased from several times the critical micellar concentration (cmc) to just below the cmc. High-speed observations of bubble bursting reveal that the position at which a hole nucleates in the bubble cap also depends on the surfactant concentration. On average{,} the rupture is initiated close to the bubble foot for low concentrations (<cmc) while its locus moves towards the top of the bubble cap as the concentration increases above the cmc. In order to explain this transition{,} we propose that marginal regeneration may be responsible for bubble rupture at low concentrations but that bursting at the apex for higher concentrations is driven by gravitational drainage."

 abstract = "On the basis of experimental observations described earlier, we have proposed that marginal regeneration is caused by surface tension gradients at the borders of mobile foam films. Marginal regeneration is the rate-determining mechanism in the drainage of such films, and, as such, a determining factor in the persistence (or long-term stability) of foams. Marangoni flows are caused by surface tension gradients, and these set off the exchange of thicker for thin film elements along the borders, while the total film area remains the same. In this paper we present simulations of the drainage of liquid in a vertical soap film, and show that it is realistic to expect large surface tension gradients along the lower border of the film under the conditions which lead to marginal regeneration."

These {\textquotedblleft}bare{\textquotedblright} films display unusual dynamic behaviors in drainage and rupture. Two different model systems were studied: a polymer melt (silicone oil) and a molten (borosilicate) glass of comparable viscosity. Although the two systems differ greatly in their relaxation time, they are described by the same set of laws, which can be understood from a relatively simple hydrodynamic model.},
