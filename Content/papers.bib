  abstract = "Thin film technology is a mature field encompassing a wide range of applications such as electronics, optical communications, and biosystems. The list of potential applications is practically endless with an impact in nearly every industrial sector. Many thin film applications are linked to developments in the semiconductor industry such as thin film transistors, large-area displays, microelectromechanical/nanoelectromechanical systems, planar waveguides, and magnetic data storage. This introductory chapter provides a new insight into nanostructured thin films. It gives an overview on the application on thin films, a general classification of nanostructured thin films, a brief introduction of the methods of synthesis of these nanostructures. Finally, the chapter discusses the challenges faced during the scale-up of the processes and the most important aspects to be considered when planning the industrialization of a developed process."

 abstract = {Thin liquid films are central to everyday life. They are ubiquitous in modern technology (pharmaceuticals, coatings), consumer products (foams, emulsions) and also serve vital biological functions (tear film of the eye, pulmonary surfactants in the lung). A common feature in all these examples is the presence of surface-active molecules at the air-liquid interface. Though they form only molecular-thin layers, these surfactants produce complex surface stresses on the free surface, which have important consequences for the dynamics and stability of the underlying thin liquid film. Here we conduct simple thinning experiments to explore the fundamental mechanisms that allow the surfactant molecules to slow the gravity-driven drainage of the underlying film. We present a simple model that works for both soluble and insoluble surfactant systems in the limit of negligible adsorption-desorption dynamics. We show that surfactants with finite surface rheology influence bulk flow through viscoelastic interfacial stresses, while surfactants with inviscid surfaces achieve stability through opposing surface-tension induced Marangoni flows.},

 abstract  ="In this paper{,} we investigate how the drainage and rupture of surfactant-stabilised bubbles floating at the surface of a liquid pool depend on the concentration of surface-active molecules in water. Drainage measurements at the apex of bubbles indicate that the flow profile is increasingly plug-like as the surfactant concentration is decreased from several times the critical micellar concentration (cmc) to just below the cmc. High-speed observations of bubble bursting reveal that the position at which a hole nucleates in the bubble cap also depends on the surfactant concentration. On average{,} the rupture is initiated close to the bubble foot for low concentrations (<cmc) while its locus moves towards the top of the bubble cap as the concentration increases above the cmc. In order to explain this transition{,} we propose that marginal regeneration may be responsible for bubble rupture at low concentrations but that bursting at the apex for higher concentrations is driven by gravitational drainage."

Marginal regeneration is the rate-determining mechanism in the drainage of such films, and, as such, a determining factor in the persistence (or long-term stability) of foams. Marangoni flows are caused by surface tension gradients, and these set off the exchange of thicker for thin film elements along the borders, while the total film area remains the same. In this paper we present simulations of the drainage of liquid in a vertical soap film, and show that it is realistic to expect large surface tension gradients along the lower border of the film under the conditions which lead to marginal regeneration."

These quasistable transient structures are associated with the instabilities of the complex Marangoni flows on the curved thin film in the presence of a surfactant solution. Here, we report a generalized Cahn-Hilliard-Swift-Hohenberg model derived using asymptotic theory that describes the quasielastic wrinkling pattern formation and the consequent coarsening dynamics in a curved surfactant-laden thin film. By testing the theory against experiments on soap bubbles, we find quantitative agreement with the analytical predictions of the nucleation and the early coarsening phases associated with the patterns. Our findings provide fundamental physical understanding that can be used to (de-)stabilize thin films in the presence of surfactants and have important implications for both natural and industrial contexts, such as the production of thin coating films, foams, emulsions, and sprays.},

The unstable mode — which is localized near the film border — is found to incorporate the physical characteristics of the “marginal regeneration” phenomenology proposed by Mysels. We discuss the mathematical relationship between soap film convection and Rayleigh-Benard convection in thermal cells and suggest experiments to test the analogy."

 abstract  ="Thin lubrication flows accompanying drainage from curved surfaces surround us (e.g.{,} the drainage of the tear film on our eyes). These draining aqueous layers are normally covered with surface-active molecules that render the free surface viscoelastic. The non-Newtonian character of these surfaces fundamentally alters the dynamics of drainage. We show that increased film stability during drainage can occur as a consequence of enhanced surface rheology. Increasing the surfactant layer viscosity decreases the rate of drainage; however{,} this retarding influence is most pronounced when the insoluble surfactant layer has significant elasticity. We also present a simple theoretical model that offers qualitative support to our experimental findings."}

For = 10-10erg{,} γ= 30 dyne/cm and = 100–1000 Å{,} Λ ranges from 0.6–600 and τ from a fraction of a second to several hours. The life-time and critical thickness of an unstable film are also calculated; they depend on the time constant τ and on the time of draining. The critical thickness is calculated for microscopic{,} circular films and compared with measurements of Scheludko and Exerowa. For water and aniline films{,} the calculated are 410 and 750 Å respectively{,} whereas the experimental values are 270 and 410 Å."}
