## Hydrodynamics experiments with soap films and soap bubbles: A short review of recent experiments [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4986003){:target="_blank"}
Review recent experiments which use the near 2 Dimensional Characteristics of thin films to study turbulent effects and friction drag.

New theories of friction drag were tested thanks to the ability of the thin film to show different turbulent spectra.

Turbulent effects such as vortices were studied at a small scale in thin films to be related to their large scale, macroscopic counterparts. Predicting or modelling their movement, intensity or lifetime is extremely difficult due to the complexity of the interactions they have with the external environment.

Half bubble is heated from the bottom and rotated to mimic atmospheric flows. Then fluid structures can be observed using normal colour cameras (to give the thickness field), or through Laser
Doppler velocimetry (to get the velocities). Analysis of results and comparison to tropical cyclones.

## Introductory Lecture: Mechanics of soft interfaces  [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1039/fd9960400001){:target="_blank"}

First part of the lecture is about the bursting of soap films. Outlines Culik's approach and developments made to expand it. Features a lot of mathematical and in depth explanations.
