## Hydrodynamics experiments with soap films and soap bubbles: A short review of recent experiments [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4986003){:target="_blank"}
Review recent experiments which use the near 2 Dimensional Characteristics of thin films to study turbulent effects and friction drag.

New theories of friction drag were tested thanks to the ability of the thin film to show different turbulent spectra.

Turbulent effects such as vortices were studied at a small scale in thin films to be related to their large scale, macroscopic counterparts. Predicting or modelling their movement, intensity or lifetime is extremely difficult due to the complexity of the interactions they have with the external environment.

Half bubble is heated from the bottom and rotated to mimic atmospheric flows. Then fluid structures can be observed using normal colour cameras (to give the thickness field), or through Laser
Doppler velocimetry (to get the velocities). Analysis of results and comparison to tropical cyclones.

## Introductory Lecture: Mechanics of soft interfaces  [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1039/fd9960400001){:target="_blank"}

First part of the lecture is about the bursting of soap films. Outlines Culik's approach and developments made to expand it. Features a lot of mathematical and in depth explanations.

## Fluid instabilities in the birth and death of antibubbles [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/5/1/161){:target="_blank"}

**The Laplace law**: Relating radius of curvature and pressure difference across a thin film. Describing the formation and collapse dynamics of anti-bubbles. *Use of a copper wire to remove the difference in potential in the bubble, causing it to be unstable.*.
Both formation and death of these bubbles are due to fluid instabilities: birth occurs due to *Rayleigh-Plateau* instability when liquid jet occurs under the free surface, death causes difference in speed between fluid velocities inside and out and lead to *Rychtmeyer–Meshkov* instabilities.

## Bursting Bubble Aerosols [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2011.418){:target="_blank"}
*(cited by 110) CHAD PAPER*
Behaviours of tapwater (similar to seawater) bubbles, also sometime called bare films - NOT soap!!
Main focus of the paper is to find out the quantitative aerosol produced when a water bubble bursts. "Aerosol" being the hundreds of small droplets which are produced when thin film disintegrates.

(shows that effect of evaporation is negligible in lifetime and stability calculations)

## Stabilization of Thin Liquid Films by Repulsive van der Waals Force [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cis.2014.07.010){:target="_blank"}

Experimentally observe the behaviour of bubbles rising up, due to buoyancy, towards a (bare) liquid-liquid interface (non-polar oils and water). Depending on the sign of the relevant van der Waals forces, the bubble with either stop at the boundary and become stable, or break through. Add high amount of electrolyte concentration to "screen out" electrostatic interactions.

Overall, found that when the film-forming phase is the nonpolar oil, stability can always be predicted from the sign on the van der Waals forces (repulsive leads to stability). Couldn't predict stability when water was used though.


## Bursting of Bubbles at an Air-Water Interface [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1038/1731048a0){:target="_blank"}

Very early beef between two research teams who disagree about the mechanisms which appear during a bubble's rupture event. Specifically, the size of particles that emerge: one believes that two distinct fundamental mechanisms exist, one which yields a mist of very fine particles, and one which yields a jet or column of water with relatively larger particles.
