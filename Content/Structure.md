# Detailed Report Structure
## Abstract
Complete once the whole report is complete

## Project Objectives
Very simple, can copy and paste the objectives decided in the first meeting (in teams)

## Introduction
Definition of a thin film: Liquid between two gases, or a gas between two liquids (antibubbles), or liquid between a gas and a solid. Limit study to 3 fluids problem (gas-liquid-gas and liquid-gas-liquid)

Define what makes a soap bubble: presence of surfactant (brief explanation of amphiphilic properties). This is opposed to "bare" bubbles, which will be used in this paper when studying transient effects.

Explain geometries explored? curved or planar film, and multiple bubbles (foams and porous liquids)?

Outline areas that will be explored


## Stable curved films
### Role of surfactant
Detailed explanation of underlying physics behind the surface tension reducing capabilities of surfactants. Outline the different types of surfactants and how surfactant concentration affects bubble stability.

### The Marangoni Effect
Very prevalent effect, which is the driving mechanism behind the transient structures observed on bubble surface (different thicknesses lead to different light interference resulting in colours).

### Bubble Coalescence
The effects behind the merging of bubbles

### Behaviour in Electromagnetic fields
NEED TO GATHER SOURCES FOR THIS PART
(look into the levitation of bubbles using this effect)

When created, a bubble often has a charge, and that can mess with experiments. Emphasise importance of mitigating or keeping that in consideration. (some experiments do it well, others don't)


### Applications
Applications of these stable films:

- 2D flow approximation
- Study vortices
- Test models for friction (with the flowing 2D film case)
- (thin film interference, not really an application though...)


## Bubble Death (Interactions with the environment)
### Film thinning mechanisms and rupture initialisation
Film undergo thinning mechanisms which reduce its thickness either down to the thinnest possible value (black films), or directly to rupture. Location point of rupture is different between a bubble sitting on bulk liquid, or held at a small point.

Go through the main mechanisms that lead to film thickness reductions:
#### Gravity and capillary drainage
Effects which occur when the film is young, become negligible compared to the next mechanisms at thin values (I think, NEED SOURCES).

Discuss the pressure driven Poiseuille drainage rate.

#### Marginal Regeneration
Very interesting film thinning effect caused by the presence of free moving surface particles (like surfactants!). When a bubble is sitting on a bulk liquid, this film draining mechanism is orders of magnitude more significant than the usual pressure-driven Poiseuille draining.

#### Newton Black films
The thinnest possible stable bubble thickness; where it is now stable because the two boundaries are so close, the surfactant molecules can interact directly.

#### Rupture initialisation
What causes the bubble to become unstable and rupture?

- Very early paper in 1968 (Vrij A, Overbeek JThG.) talks about 'corrugations' on the surface, which cause spontaneous thinning at a critical wavelength due to an imbalance in surface Gibbs energy and van de Walls forces.
- One paper mentions the introduction of instability due to ambient evaporation (when films are at critical thicknesses) (Champougny et al)

Discuss the different methods used to purposefully rupture a bubble, (spark, needle, EM field, ultrasound ...)

### Hole Development
#### Rim Velocity
Velocity of the initially circular opening hole. Primitively modelled by the Taylor-Culick velocity, but widely accepted to be an overestimation. Go over different propositions for this deviation:

- Some papers point to the small fluid particles that are ejected from the rim (MÃ¼ller F, Stannarius R.)
- Some mention a build-up of surfactant particles on the travelling edge, causing it to take an elongated shape, and develop a surface tension gradient (Bico J.)
- A lot point to the formation of an 'aureole', where away from the opening rim, folds and 'cracks' are observed (which is where some of the energy could be going).

#### Appearance of instabilities
The bubble's hole doesn't stay circular the whole time, instabilities arrise which cause certain structures to be observed:

- Formation of ligaments
- Folds or cracks ahead of the rim

Briefly introduce the Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities


### The aftermath
After the bubble has burst, it will either disintegrate into a very thin aerosol mist, or form greater-sized droplets. This has significant impacts, especially in the analysis of this effect in sea water.


### Applications
Mention the significant role bursting (unstable) bubbles have in:

- Aerosol production
- Liquid atomization
- Drug delivery



## Improving stability
Looking back at all the effects described above, recap about how we could improve the stability of a bubble:

- Bubble make up
- Environment (low-high humidity, velocities, EM field)

## Conclusions
Not sure we need this part (the "Improving stability" section is already kind of a summary)
