# Recurring terms, definitions and standard effects
## Surfactant
Molecules which lower the surface tension at fluid boundaries (fluid-fluid, fluid-gas, fluid-solid). They are amphiphilic, meaning that on a single molecule, both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups can be observed, which drives their "surface activeness". Dynamics of the effects oberved (bubble formation, coalescence and rupture) are dependant on the diffusion coefficient of the surfactant.

## Electrolyte
Substance which separates into charged ions when dissolved in a polar solvent (e.g. water), causing the resulting solution to become electrically conducting.

## Rayleighâ€“Taylor destabilization and instability (Comes up a lot)
arise when difference in density or velocity
leaning to formation of waves and crests, common in thin films over a surface
differences in density will cause waves to appear, thickness variations appear on the surface
instability grows until crest thickness becomes too small and ligaments form

## Rheology

## Critical micelle concentration (CMC)
Concentration of surfactant above which micelles will form, at which point the surfactant molecules start to aggregate and group together instead of being evenly dispersed. Before this value, the concentration of surfactant strongly affects surface tension, after it, there is little to no change. The value is dependant on temperature, pressure and presence of other surfactants and electrolytes.
