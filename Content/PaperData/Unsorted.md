## Hydrodynamics experiments with soap films and soap bubbles: A short review of recent experiments [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4986003){:target="_blank"}
Review recent experiments which use the near 2 Dimensional Characteristics of thin films to study turbulent effects and friction drag.

New theories of friction drag were tested thanks to the ability of the thin film to show different turbulent spectra.

Turbulent effects such as vortices were studied at a small scale in thin films to be related to their large scale, macroscopic counterparts. Predicting or modelling their movement, intensity or lifetime is extremely difficult due to the complexity of the interactions they have with the external environment.

Half bubble is heated from the bottom and rotated to mimic atmospheric flows. Then fluid structures can be observed using normal colour cameras (to give the thickness field), or through Laser
Doppler velocimetry (to get the velocities). Analysis of results and comparison to tropical cyclones.

## Fluid instabilities in the birth and death of antibubbles [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/5/1/161){:target="_blank"}

**The Laplace law**: Relating radius of curvature and pressure difference across a thin film. Describing the formation and collapse dynamics of anti-bubbles. *Use of a copper wire to remove the difference in potential in the bubble, causing it to be unstable.*.
Both formation and death of these bubbles are due to fluid instabilities: birth occurs due to *Rayleigh-Plateau* instability when liquid jet occurs under the free surface, death causes difference in speed between fluid velocities inside and out and lead to *Rychtmeyer–Meshkov* instabilities.

## Bursting Bubble Aerosols [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2011.418){:target="_blank"}
*ITS ACTUALLY CITED BY ALSMOST EVERYONE*
**NEED TO READ THIS PROPERLY**
Behaviours of tapwater (similar to seawater) bubbles, also sometime called bare films - NOT soap!!
Main focus of the paper is to find out the quantitative aerosol produced when a water bubble bursts. "Aerosol" being the hundreds of small droplets which are produced when thin film disintegrates.

(shows that effect of evaporation is negligible in lifetime and stability calculations)

Flat films are useful to be studied in 2D when surface viscosity (driven by high surfactant conc.) is large enough to dissipate all motion in the plane. But can't be used in bubbles, where convective motions are integral to describing the drainage.

Describes the hole nucleation event through the bubble cap as stochastic. With activation energy of `sigma*h^2` (sigma is surface tension, h is surface tension).

Say that the formation of ligaments result from the inertial destabilization of the rim. Were Rayleigh-Taylor destabilization is the selection mechanism. This paper disproves Spiel's findings (Spiel1998, "On the births of film  drops from bubbles bursting on seawater surfaces", talks about "beads" forming along the surface, at which surface tension can't maintain centripetal accelerations and get ejected always at the same angle (31deg) independent of bubble size and surface tension).

Describes the bubble shape as a function of capillary length (a = sqrt(omega/rho g)). Neglects the weight of the cap (as thickness h is very small), and considers surface tension constant along the cap. Shape depends on the contained volume and conditions at the base (meniscus). Small bubbles will tend to be spherical and stay mostly under the surface, with a small cap angle, whereas bigger bubbles will tend to be more half-spherical and stick out.

Drainage of the cap is driven by capillary pressure inside the cap (2sigma/R) or hydrostatic pressure (rho g R) depending on the ratio R/a (when <=5, calpillary draiange dominates).

References the Debregeas drainage time for 'bare' molten glass bubbles, to show that pure water bubbles would drain almost immediately, as the only force that might slow down drainage is only viscosity. However show that for non-distilled water, the bubbles can exist for longer than 1s (**Significance of water purity; a very small amount of surfactant is required to improve lifetime significantly.**).

Looking at low surfactant concentration tap water bubbles with "mobile" monolayers, which they argue can safely be extended to seawater bubbles at the surface of oceans.

## Stabilization of Thin Liquid Films by Repulsive van der Waals Force [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cis.2014.07.010){:target="_blank"}
Experimentally observe the behaviour of bubbles rising up, due to buoyancy, towards a (bare) liquid-liquid interface (non-polar oils and water). Depending on the sign of the relevant van der Waals forces, the bubble with either stop at the boundary and become stable, or break through. Add high amount of electrolyte concentration to "screen out" electrostatic interactions.

Overall, found that when the film-forming phase is the nonpolar oil, stability can always be predicted from the sign on the van der Waals forces (repulsive leads to stability). Couldn't predict stability when water was used though.

## Bursting of Bubbles at an Air-Water Interface [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1038/1731048a0){:target="_blank"}
Very early beef between two research teams who disagree about the mechanisms which appear during a bubble's rupture event. Specifically, the size of particles that emerge: one believes that two distinct fundamental mechanisms exist, one which yields a mist of very fine particles, and one which yields a jet or column of water with relatively larger particles.

## THE DYNAMICS OF THIN FILMS I and II [:material-pdf-box:](http://www.jstor.org/stable/118341){:target="_blank"}
Provide a summary of all the developments made to models for thin film stability. Mentions that they are all mostly focused on including the effects of van der Waals interactions, and surface tension effects from surfactants, for semi-inifite planar films, those who's edges aren't bound by solid boundaries. Main aim is to extend these models, including "the effects of van der Waals forces, surface tension, inertia, and surfactant concentration" , and produce a set of applicable equations which determine the dynamics of the thin film.

Other than van der Waals effects, Surface tension is the main effect in their model?
**Marangoni dimensionless number characterizes variation in surface tension due to varying surfactant concentrations**.

>  van der Waals forces are intermolecular forces which, because of the thinness of the films we wish to consider, can have profound effects on the behaviour of the film; while insoluble surfactant concentrations, because they induce spatial gradients in the surface tension, can give rise to shear stresses at the film interfaces which cannot be ignored

## The Life and Death of “Bare” Viscous Bubbles [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.279.5357.1704){:target="_blank"}
Looking into the dynamics of very viscous polymer melt air bubbles (a million times more viscous that water). Bubbles stable for several minutes. Observe and model the thickness variation over time due to film drainage. The fact that viscosity is so much higher means they can more easily study the ageing of the films. Simply state that when the film is thin enough, van der Waals interactions accelerate the thinning to bursting.
