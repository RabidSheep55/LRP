## Comments on a Ruptured Soap Film [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1735765){:target="_blank"}
Discrepancy between calculated and measured values, seems to be caused by neglecting the inelastic acceleration of the fluid
around the edge of the newly created hole. Indeed, when that is considered, the assumption of constant film thickness and uniform properties will break down. This article details how the mass increase along the edge, as well as increased surface forces due to pressure differences can be included in calculations.

 - Discrepancy between measured and calculated vals
 - Consider mass buildup around edge -> extra point of energy loss

    - With added surface forces

## Comparison of the rupture dynamics of smectic bubbles and soap bubbles [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1080/02678290802699300){:target="_blank"}
**Introduction gives great insight into the current state of knowledge and experiments on the dynamics of bursting bubbles.** Includes the generally accepted model for describing the burst of a thin liquid film (**Culick’s velocity**). However more recent experiments have recorded much smaller values. This is caused by the fact that instabilities grow along the edge of the growing hole, causing small droplets to escape the rim, meaning its mass is reduced compared to Culick's model, resulting in a slower rim velocity.

Experimental methods are carried out to measure:
- Initial film thickness
- Rim velocity
- Scattering of transmitted light
- Film thickening before rupture
- Rim fragmentation (release of small droplets from the moving rim)

> The most striking phenomenon during the rupture of soap films, discovered by McEntee, Mysels and Frankel is the appearance of a considerable disturbance in front of the rim, which is called the __aureole__ by these authors (6, 7)

## Cracks in bursting soap films [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2015.376){:target="_blank"}

Great overview article, goes over the mechanisms of amphiphilic surfactant molecules and their behaviours and roles in surface tension. Goes on to rupture dynamics and surface rheology. Really relies on the paper by P. C. Petit, M. Le Merrer and A.-L. Biance about the study of 'rigid' soap films.

Explains how P. C. Petit et. al. provide an explanation for the deviation from the Tayor-Culick rim velocity: surfactant molecules build-up along the rim, inducing gradient in surface tension with the rest of the film. This causes its cross-section to deviate to an elongated circular shape.

## Opening and retraction of particulate soap films [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1209/0295-5075/111/26001){:target="_blank"}

(cited by Cracks in bursting soap films Bico, J)

Study of particulate film dynamics: thin films which have solid hydrophobic particles attached at their interfaces. They place some polystyrene beads on the film in monolayer and bilayer configurations and study the opening and retraction dynamics. For bilayer, the beads only touch one of the liquid-air interfaces, whereas in the monolayer setup, they intersect both interfaces of the film.

Not too sure about their result considering their bilayer experiments: it agrees with the Taylor-Culick rim velocity equation (when accounting for the inertia of the beads), which has been "disproven" time and time again (I think).

## Influence of Evaporation on Soap Film Rupture [:material-pdf-box:](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b04235){:target="_blank"}

Pretty good summary of the effects that lead to film thinning: Gravity and capillary drainage, marginal regeneration due to patches formed near the menisci, formation of 'black film' which, initially stable due to the "repulsion between surfactant-laden interfaces of the film", becomes unstable due to surface concentration heterogeneities causing thickness instabilities (references Lhuissier, Bursting Bubbles).

Argue that evaporation, adding an external flux from film to atmosphere, could accelerate the thinning mechanisms, and even be cause/accelerate the instabilities observed: for heterogeneous interfaces, local evaporation will vary as stabilizing agents can influence those rates, causing temperature and surface concentration gradients, which would lead to further instabilities.

Experimental results show that the thinning dynamics are almost not affected by evaporation. However, discover that evaporation becomes important at the 'black film' level, close to rupture. Propose that rupture occurs when mass loss due to evaporation is of the order of mass loss due to film drainage at the top of the film.

## Rupture of Thin Liquid Films Due to Spontaneous Fluctuations in Thickness [:material-pdf-box:](http://doi.org/10.1021/ja01014a015){:target="_blank"}
*(seems like a cornerstone paper, been cited a lot)*

> black soap films — black, because interference between light reflected from the front side and that reflected from the back side leads to nearly complete extinction of the reflected light

Talks about thin soap films as having rough surfaces; if the corrugations have a wavelength larger than a critical value, they will grow spontaneously and cause the film to rupture. Surface tension acts against the thickness variations, whereas "Van der Waals" forces will act to move particles from thinner areas towards thicker, accentuating thickness variations. This paper poses that if the decrease in van der Waals energy more than compensates the increase in surface Gibbs energy (the corrugated film has a larger surface area, therefore more surface energy), then the deformation would spontaneously grow and lead to either a full rupture, or stabilisation to 'black film'.

*Note: This reminds me of the Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, the growth of an instability due to a density gradient.*

**Showed typical time required for a van der Waals driven thickness instability to grow is proportional to the film thickness to the power of 5**

Need to find out how right they were... What do more recent papers say about this one??

## Possible Mechanism for the Spontaneous Rupture of Thin, Free Liquid Films [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1039/DF9664200023){:target="_blank"}
Describes a model for the thinning phenomena in free films, down to critical thickness and rupture. Comes up with a critical wavelength for fluctuations which cause rupture. This wavelength is dependant on surface tension and the "Free energy of interaction" (essentially the intermolecular forces acting in the surfactant bilayer).

Black film rupture occurs unpredictably due to lack of control over environment: thermal shock, vibration, dust. These are unlikely to cause hole nucleation in thicker films due to high activation energy, mechanism is therefore only relevant in those thin bilayers.

Unstable, or transient films, rupture spontaneously. Main working theory at the time is thermal fluctuations cause surface "corrugations", which grow over time, and when a critical wavelength is reached, cause spontaneous rupture.

Soluble surfactants that have a low viscosity, will lead to their amphiphiles being able to move freely and relatively quickly along the fluid boundaries. Whereas insoluble (molecules still in the solid phase), or high viscosity surfactants, will not, and form what is called a "rigid" surface.

## Thinning of soap films [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1016/0001-8686(94)80033-2){:target="_blank"}

Newton black films are so thin that barely any light gets reflected, which causes them to appear invisible. (and black when in front of a black background).
Mysels classified in 3 categories of surfactant films:

- Rigid films: monolayers are extremely compact and rigid
- Simple mobile films: Rapid turbulent motion observed (driven by marangoni effect, and said to be triggered by marginial regeneration flows Lhuissier2011), and "thickness of the center is uniform" eg for low conc soluble surfactants.
- Irregular mobile films: High conc surfactant, larger thickness surfactants observed, "Stratification"

If molecular interactions between the two surfactant monolayers are attractive, thinning accelerates rapidly and leads to rupture, but if they are repulsive, the pressure balanced capillary forces and a metastable equilibrium is reached. For the latter, "External disturbances, or thermal fluctuations, may produce its rupture."

References the model what Vrij1968 came up with: When applied pressure is larger than disjoining pressure. Although his model yields good values for critical thickness, points out the discrepancies:
