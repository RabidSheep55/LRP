## Transient structures in rupturing thin films: Marangoni-induced symmetry-breaking pattern formation in viscous fluids [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abb0597){:target="_blank"}
Before a rupture event, black spots (Newtonian black films) appear with a certain structure. These undergo a "coarsening" process where they grow in size by merging, until one big area forms before the bubble bursts. These structures are drastically different for convex and concave bubbles (looking at the top or bottom hemispheres of the film). This paper goes through the creation and development of a model capable of describing these structures (not using Navier-Stokes but field something something).

## Merging of soap bubbles and why surfactant matters [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5135764){:target="_blank"}
Experimental study, look at processes observed when 2 soap bubbles merge, in particular what happens just before the merge occurs. First they are created using surfactant solution at CMC, brought closer to each other, they coalesce and share a flat film surface. Initially right before coalescence, as they approach each other, a dimple is formed between them (trapped gas pocket), they then meet at a point which, grows radially due to surface tension), although that liquid bridge is initially smooth and circular, its extreme acceleration and the fact that it will travel faster in the area of the dimple, will cause the rim to become modulated and unstable and leave behind structures like radial streaks (**Rayleigh–Taylor
instability**). They develop a model to describe this behaviour.

- [++] repeatable: made sure the bubbles weren't charged (controlled it using copper wire)
- [++] repeated experiment 50 times
