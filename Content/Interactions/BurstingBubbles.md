Discrepancy between calculated and measured values, seems to be caused by neglecting the inelastic acceleration of the fluid
around the edge of the newly created hole. Indeed, when that is considered, the assumption of constant film thickness and uniform properties will break down. This article details how the mass increase along the edge, as well as increased surface forces due to pressure differences can be included in calculations.

 - Dynamics of bursting soap films (velocity)
 - Discrepancy between measured and calculated vals
 - Consider mass buildup around edge -> extra point of energy loss
    - In eq of motion
    - With added surface forces

Very short, great pictures of close up fluid structures exhibited by bursting bubbles (ligaments). Mention of **Rayleigh–Taylor destabilization**...
