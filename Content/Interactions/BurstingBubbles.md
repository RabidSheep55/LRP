## Comments on a Ruptured Soap Film [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1735765){:target="_blank"}
Discrepancy between calculated and measured values, seems to be caused by neglecting the inelastic acceleration of the fluid
around the edge of the newly created hole. Indeed, when that is considered, the assumption of constant film thickness and uniform properties will break down. This article details how the mass increase along the edge, as well as increased surface forces due to pressure differences can be included in calculations.

 - Dynamics of bursting soap films (velocity)
 - Discrepancy between measured and calculated vals
 - Consider mass buildup around edge -> extra point of energy loss
    - In eq of motion
    - With added surface forces

## Comparison of the rupture dynamics of smectic bubbles and soap bubbles [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1080/02678290802699300){:target="_blank"}
**Introduction gives great insight into the current state of knowledge and experiments on the dynamics of bursting bubbles.** Includes the generally accepted model for describing the burst of a thin liquid film (**Culick’s velocity**). However more recent experiments have recorded much smaller values. This is caused by the fact that instabilities grow along the edge of the growing hole, causing small droplets to escape the rim, meaning its mass is reduced compared to Culick's model, resulting in a slower rim velocity.

Experimental methods are carried out to measure:
- Initial film thickness
- Rim velocity
- Scattering of transmitted light
- Film thickening before rupture
- Rim fragmentation (release of small droplets from the moving rim)

> The most striking phenomenon during the rupture of soap films, discovered by McEntee, Mysels and Frankel is the appearance of a considerable disturbance in front of the rim, which is called the __aureole__ by these authors (6, 7)
