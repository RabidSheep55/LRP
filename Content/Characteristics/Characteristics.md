## Effect of surfactant concentration on the critical thicknesses of liquid films [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01558157){:target="_blank"}

Experimental study, Main finding is that a decreased concentration in surfactant increases the critical thickness (more surfactant will allow formation of thinner bubbles) up to a point, where the critical thickness stays constant even at increased concentrations. **Note: this is the CMC, a known characteristic of surfactants, but the paper doesn't mention it anywhere (although oldest mention I could find of the CMC was 1971)**. Link between critical thickness and formation of black spots. With detergent type surfactants, black spots will appear on the bubble before it bursts, whereas other types will spontaneously rupture.

## Surface tension of flowing soap films [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2018.28){:target="_blank"}

State that usual experimental methods for surface tensions estimation can't be used in this situation: some require a bulk liquid (which aren't indicative of their thin film counterparts), some rely on meniscus formation (in which the surface chemistry varies drastically - NOT CITED), and some rely on the insertion of deformable objects (can't be used as film has a velocity).

Propose and test a way of measuring the surface tension of a 2D flow approximating flowing soap film channel setup: Use the fact that this uses two nylon wires tensioned by a known weight to record their deflections and extract a value for surface tension.

Only really use 3 concentrations of surfactants (by volume), that's not enough imo. But the method is pretty cool.

Finds that increased thickness and soap concentration will decrease surface tension.
