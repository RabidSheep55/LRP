# Topics to look into
## Characteristics of bubbles (which affect stability maybe?)
- Role of surfactant
- Classification -> Formation
- Temperature?
- Forces
    * Pressure
    * EM attraction (due to water being polar molecule)
    * Surface tension
    * Gravity (causing liquid buildup and concentration disparities?)
- Uses and applications

## Behaviours to look into?
- Marangoni effect
- Black spots and Newton black films
- Isolated Vortices in Soap Bubbles
- Interaction with EM fields
- Role in heat transfer problems (boilers) not really soap bubbles though
- Dynamics of bubble bursting (equations inelastic process at lip of growing hole due to mass buildup)
- Bubble coalescence and merging
- Bubble pinchoff events
- surfactants responsible for espresso crema
- layer structure which constitutes the thin film
- liquid film drainage (thinning)
- Plateau borders

## Questions
- A lot of older papers place a lot of importance on Van Der Waals forces, why do more recent papers not even mention them? (that's basically the opposite of diffusion right?)

## Storytelling
a) General comments what is the focus of your study

- definition of thin film as liquid between two gases, or a gas between two liquids, or liquid between a gas and solid. Focus limited to a 3 fluids problem
- geometry: curved film (bubbles and anti-bubbles) or planar film
- static or flowing thin films
- liquid with multiple bubbles (foams, porous liquids)

b) Describe curved films (soap bubbles) and their peculiarities

- role of surfactant, gravity, pressure,
- role of surface tension

c) Interactions with the environment -> a this film or a  bubble is in general not always stable

- planar thin film -> formation of ligaments or droplets depending on the relative velocity with the environment
- Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities
- a bubble could burst and related dynamics
- coalescence of bubble
- marangoni effect
- instability and bursting with electromagnetic fields

d) applications of thin films (optional)

- liquid atomization (airblast atomizers)
- drug delivery
- others

e) Discuss how we can change the stability characteristics

- more surfactant? Up to what limit?
- less relative velocity?


## Storytelling notes

Need to go over the reason for film bursting, and causes different papers might attribute to that effect:

- Very early paper in 1968 (Vrij A, Overbeek JThG.) talks about 'corrugations' on the surface, which cause spontaneous thinning at a critical wavelength due to an imbalance in surface Gibbs energy and van de Walls forces.
- One paper mentions the introduction of instability due to ambient evaporation (when films are at critical thicknesses) (Champougny et al)
-


When going over bursting bubbles and their rim velocity. Go over different propositions for the deviation from the Taylor-Culick velocity (most of the time, the measured velocities are lower than those predicted by that primitive model):

- Some papers point to the small fluid particles that are ejected from the rim (MÃ¼ller F, Stannarius R.)
- Some mention a build-up of surfactant particles on the travelling edge, causing it to take an elongated shape, and develop a surface tension gradient (Bico J.)
- A lot point to the formation of an 'aureole', where away from the opening rim, folds and 'cracks' are observed (which is where some of the energy could be going).
