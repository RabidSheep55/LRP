# Topics to look into
## Characteristics of bubbles (which affect stability maybe?)
- Role of surfactant
- Classification -> Formation
- Temperature?
- Forces
    * Pressure
    * EM attraction (due to water being polar molecule)
    * Surface tension
    * Gravity (causing liquid buildup and concentration disparities?)
- Uses and applications

## Behaviours to look into?
- Marangoni effect
- Black spots and Newton black films
- Isolated Vortices in Soap Bubbles
- Interaction with EM fields
- Role in heat transfer problems (boilers) not really soap bubbles though
- Dynamics of bubble bursting (equations inelastic process at lip of growing hole due to mass buildup)
- Bubble coalescence and merging
- Bubble pinchoff events
- surfactants responsible for espresso crema
- layer structure which constitutes the thin film
- liquid film drainage (thinning)
- Plateau borders

## Storytelling
a) General comments what is the focus of your study
    - definition of thin film as liquid between two gases, or a gas between two liquids, or liquid between a gas and solid. Focus limited to a 3 fluids problem
    - geometry: curved film (bubbles and anti-bubbles) or planar film
    - liquid with multiple bubbles (foams, porous liquids)

b) Describe curved films (soap bubbles) and their peculiarities
    - role of surfactant, gravity, pressure,
    - role of surface tension

c) Interactions with the environment -> a this film or a  bubble is in general not always stable
    - planar thin film -> formation of ligaments or droplets depending on the relative velocity with the environment
    - Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities
    - a bubble could burst and related dynamics
    - coalescence of bubble
    - marangoni effect
    - instability and bursting with electromagnetic fields

d) applications of thin films (optional)
    - liquid atomization (airblast atomizers)
    - drug delivery
    - others

e) Discuss how we can change the stability characteristics
    - more surfactant? Up to what limit?
    - less relative velocity?
