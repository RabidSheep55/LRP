# Topics to look into
## Characteristics of bubbles (which affect stability maybe?)
- Role of surfactant
- Classification -> Formation
- Temperature?
- Forces
    * Pressure
    * EM attraction (due to water being polar molecule)
    * Surface tension
    * Gravity (causing liquid buildup and concentration disparities?)
- Uses and applications

## Behaviours to look into?
- Marangoni effect
- Black spots and Newton black films
- Isolated Vortices in Soap Bubbles
- Interaction with EM fields
- Role in heat transfer problems (boilers) not really soap bubbles though
- Dynamics of bubble bursting (equations inelastic process at lip of growing hole due to mass buildup)
- Bubble coalescence and merging
- Bubble pinchoff events
- surfactants responsible for espresso crema
- layer structure which constitutes the thin film
- liquid film drainage (thinning)
- Plateau borders
- Aerosol production during film bursting
- Bubble drainage (due to pressure-driven Poiseuille flow, but most importantly due to marginal regeneration)

## Questions
- A lot of older papers place a lot of importance on Van Der Waals forces, why do more recent papers not even mention them? (that's basically the opposite of diffusion right?)
