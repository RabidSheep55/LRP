## Effect of surfactant concentration on the critical thicknesses of liquid films [:material-pdf-box:](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01558157){:target="_blank"}

Experimental study, Main finding is that a decreased concentration in surfactant increases the critical thickness (more surfactant will allow formation of thinner bubbles) up to a point, where the critical thickness stays constant even at increased concentrations. **Note: this is the CMC, a known characteristic of surfactants, but the paper doesn't mention it anywhere (although oldest mention I could find of the CMC was 1971)**. Link between critical thickness and formation of black spots. With detergent type surfactants, black spots will appear on the bubble before it bursts, whereas other types will spontaneously rupture.
